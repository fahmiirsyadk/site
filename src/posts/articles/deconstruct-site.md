## Incomplete

There are 2 kinds of people, people who like to focus on reflection but describe themselves with poetry or any journal & people who make websites like museums full of his latest works.

The first one, they hold the concept of simplicity, fully focused on how they express themselves in writing. And last one, they just (all in) express all their imagination on canvas.

I'm the second type, admited that creating a personal website is difficult because the creators want to make the best website they have ever made. they liken it to a canvas, painting according to the imagination and mood of the painter. They often lose track of time, making the artwork incomplete and the painter exhausted. Or halfway through, they get bored or bothered by another idea and throw away the canvas and start a new painting. The cycle never ends.

The way to break it is to mark that the painting is <b>Done</b>.

> *After two years working, i mark this site Done.*
